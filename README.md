This repository includes a jupyter notebook where I open the .tbz2 file and extract WGS information into a seperate directory.
I made dataframes and dictionaries from this data and proceeded to do some data analysis to specimens that have similar SNPs.
Install the required libraries with pip install -r requirements.txt
